# A First Course on Reinforcement Learning with Python

This is the code for my journey of learning 'Reinforcement Learning' from scratch. I will continuously add more content as I progress in my studies, and I welcome any exchanges.

这是我从零开始学习“强化学习”的代码之旅。随着学习的深入，我将不断添加更多内容，并欢迎任何形式的交流。

## 1. 01_MAB_BernoulliBandit

### Multi-Armed Bandit Problem Implementation - Bernoulli Bandit

Implement UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) and e-Greedy algorithms for a multi-armed bandit problem with k=10 arms. Each arm's reward follows a Bernoulli distribution. Provide a Python program that implements both algorithms and plots their performance comparison.

## 2. 01_MAB_GaussianBandit

### Multi-Armed Bandit Problem Implementation - Gaussian Bandit

Implement UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) and e-Greedy algorithms for a multi-armed bandit problem with k=15 arms. Each arm's reward follows a Gaussian distribution with means ranging from 1 to 15 and a standard deviation of 1.
